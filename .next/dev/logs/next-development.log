[00:00:00.684] Server  ERROR   (node:9172) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///C:/Projects/my-first-next-js/next.config.js is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to C:\Projects\my-first-next-js\package.json.
(Use `node --trace-warnings ...` to show where the warning was created)
